Why let such a weak man lead our nation after four great years of progress under yours truly? Furthermore, Cone opposes the bonus bill like much of the do nothing state legislature. His election will spell heart aches for much of the suffering state. What is one election for the sake of saving Florida’s soul?

His Florida Legion, the Florida branch of the American Legion, has many  roughnecks joining on the basis of them being in the current Army. Some of these men have been calling President Sholtz the Fat Yankee Kike, based on his Northern jewish orgin. Such things are causing trouble within our coalition.

    SFL_jacksonville_work_camps: "Jacksonville Work Camps" 
    SFL_jacksonville_work_camps_desc: 0 “ Generalissimo Lowry has many enemies in the nation. They say he’s a power hungry dictator who just wants to rule. Many of these people are openly denouncing our dear Generalisimo. On top of that socialists and labor unions are still causing trouble. Lowry has decided to send these people to Jacksonville to do some hard labor. Doing so will get some much needed public projects done as well as shut our opposition up. Hopefully when they return they’ll see our Generalissimo can do no wrong.”
