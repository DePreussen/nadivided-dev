    ORIN.2.t:0 "History of the Republic of Oregon"
    ORIN.2.d:0 "When California left the Union in February of 1932, the Giant of the Pacific took Oregon and Washington with her. Oregon was happy enough to go along with this plan, after all, Oregon and Cali's economies had become more intertwined ever since the Great Depression. While Washington could, economically anyway, stand on her own two feet, Oregon was far from economically stable. The only reason the economy didn't implode right at her independence was due to massive amounts of cash flowing in from Sacramento. This situation placed Oregon in the situation of being a puppet of California in all but name. Even the flag of the Republic of Oregon, adopted on July 4th, 1932, reflects the so-called \"special relationship\" Oregon has with California.\n The first major threat to the existence of the newly established Republic was not in fact an economic implosion. It was a Revolution. To be exact, a communist revolution, led by the reorganized Communist Party of Oregon, headed by newly elected chairman John 'Jack' Reed. Reed since 1917 had been in the Soviet Union, first simply as a journalist, but as the Union began to fall apart, he was trained by the Red Army on the arts of Gruella Warfare. Just as Lenin was sent into Russia by Germany to led a revolution, so was Reed returned to Oregon, under an assumed name of course. Reed was to led the workers of Oregon in a glorious Revolution to overthrow the corrupt Republican government and create a bastion of socialism on the west coast. From Oregon, Reed would led the Red Army to bring the Revolution to the entirety to America, and be hailed as the American Lenin.\n As soon as Reed got off the boat, he was able to link up with his Comrades in the CPO(most notable his wife, Louise Bryant, who had been leading the CPO in his stead) and tell them of the glorious Revolutionary Plan, which as loyal party members they begin to prepare for immediately. In total, it took about six months to be able gather enough men and guns for the uprising. The vast bulk of the Oregon Red Army was made up of either rank and file members of the CPO, lumbermen who had been members of the IWW, or simple mercenaries, as the Soviet Union had been sending the CPO massive amounts of counterfeit currency to help prepare for the uprising. It was on August 15th 1932 that the Oregon Red Army rose up all around the former state, although the bulk of the Red Army was in the Willamette Valley, near Salem.\n To call the initial uprising a failure would be to do a massive disservice to the ORA. For nearly two weeks, the ORA was able to stand it's ground, even holding Portland for a two-day period until the National Guard took the city back. After those first two weeks however, the ORA was no threat at all to the forces of the National Guard. After the Battle of Springfield, the western half of ORA was forced underground, with most retreating either towards the Coast or the Cascades.  Although the ORA was crushed in the Willamette Valley by the Oregon National Guard, Eastern Oregon was a different story. As the National Guard was tied up protecting the Capital, the Red Army was able to take vast swaths of the Eastern half of Oregon, stretching from Prineville to Enterprise.\n As the National Guard was cleaning up the Willamette Valley, and the ORA was digging in around Eastern Oregon, many feared that Oregon was soon going to be having it's own version of the Russian Civil War. That was until Baker. George Luis Baker, born in 1868, had been the mayor of Portland since 1917. When Oregon declared itself a Republic early in the year, he had stepped down from his office in favor of playing to a higher degree of politics. Shortly after stepping down as Mayor of Portland, Baker, along with members of the Democratic Party, the Oregon Klan, the Masonic Grand Lodge of Oregon and various Share Our Wealth Societies formed the 'Oregon Democratic People's Party'. Just as the ORA was preparing for their Revolution, Baker was going around Oregon, giving speeches, shaking hands and the like, in perpetration for the upcoming 1932 elections. However, when the ORA began their uprising, Baker was not silent. He began giving speech after speech denouncing the Communists, calling and all Oregonians to rise up and crush the 'Greatest threat to our way of life' and this call did not fall on deaf ears. All around the former State militias began to form in response to both Baker's call and the seeming lack of willingness of the Oregon National Guard to deal with the ORA past the Cascades. These militias, made up of veterans of the Great War, simple farmers, die hard ideologies and chapters of the Klan were loyal solely to Baker and his ODPP.\n As the National Guard and ORA both began to solidify the ground that they had taken, the ORA in the East was suddenly attacked by the ODPP's militias! The militias were merciless in their attacks on the ORA, in fact, in serval cases, ORA members who surrender were executed, in clear extrajudicial faction. Furthermore, in towns taken by militias made up of Klansmen it was not unheard of for both Blacks and Catholics to \"disappear\" overnight. As the ORA was being attacked by ODPP militias, the National Guard was quick to take advantage, and they crossed the Cascades, making quick work of the Reds.\n It was in the early part of March, 1934, that Reed ordered all ORA units to retreat to the \"Cascade base area\", a small stretch of land smack dab in the middle of the Mountain range that split Oregon in two. He did this at the behest of the Soviet Military Mission that had been slowly flooding into Oregon since the start of the uprising. This marked the effective end of the CPO's \"revolution\".\n Since the recall order, the CPO and it's ORA have not been heard from. Following the retreat of the ORA, those militias belonging to the ODPP and National Guard almost ended in a war themselves, as the National Guard demanded that the militias stand-down and relinquish their firearms. The only thing that stopped this from turning in to a second pursing was the \"Militias Act of 1934\", an act which was  forced through the Oregon Leisure by the ODPP, both by using the seats they had as well as bribery, blackmail, and other such tools. The act states that militias, as long as the pose no threat to the Republic or it's people, have the legal right to exist.\n In 1934-35, after the uprising was dealt with, the Republican Constitution was drafted. Little was changed in between it and the State Constitution, save for the addition of a Bill of Rights. 1934 was also the year the first elections of the Republic took place. The clear winner was the Oregon Democratic-Republican Party, a merger of the old Republican and Democratic parties(the two merged for national stability in 1933) Julius Meier, the man who had led Oregon to her nationhood, was reelected with a clear majority. As for other parties, the ODPP was able to sway about a third of the electorate, giving them the ability to make or break any bill that goes through the legislature."
