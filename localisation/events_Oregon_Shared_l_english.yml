    OS.0.t:0 "Communists Seize Springfield"
    OS.0.d:0  "Just as many in the upper echelons of the National Guard feared, the Oregon Red Army has finally made a move, and under the shadow of darkness, seized the city of Springfield. This gives them a base from which to strike Salem with. The Red Army is still on the move however, and Governor Meier is expected to respond any minute now..."
    OS.0.a:0 "Those Damn Reds!"

    OS.1.t:0 "Governor Meier Declares Martial Law"
    OS.1.d:0 "With Communist forces only a scant few hours from Salem,Governor Meier has decided too, with little legal basis, declared that the entirety of Oregon, from Astoria to Rome, is now under martial law. He is hoping above all, that with no legislative oversight, he will be able to crush the rebels once and for all!"
    OS.1.a:0 "Let us hope he is right"

    OS.2.t:0 "Portland and Astoria fall to Communist forces"
    OS.2.d:0 "Horrible News! The Oregon Red Army, despite the National Guard putting up a valiant defense, have taken Portland! What is worse, our port city in the mouth of the Columbia, Astoria was also taken by Communist forces in a surprise attack! With the loss of Portland and Astoria, the Reds completely control shipping on the Oregon side of the Columbia. It also appears that the Soviet Union, watching all of this, and perhaps even commanding it, from afar have begun sending the ORA shipments of arms, ammo and food."
    OS.2.a:0 "Dammit!"
   
    OS.3.t:0 "Reed proclaims the Socialist Republic of Oregon"
    OS.3.d:0 "Following the stunning victories of the Oregon Red Army in the past few weeks,  John Reed, Chairman of the Oregon Communist Party, has proclaimed the creation of the Socialist Republic of Oregon, laying claim to the whole of Oregon. As of now, a state of uneasy peace, much like the peace between the Union and Confederacy before the American Civil War took off, exists in Oregon. This may be the last glimpse of peace Oregon will see for years to come..."
    OS.3.a:0 "OREGON WILL NEVER FALL TO COMMUNIST INVASION!"
    OS.3.b:0 "Workers of Oregon, your liberation is here!"
    
    OS.4.t:0 "George Baker issues the 'Baker Declaration'"
    OS.4.d:0 "Geroge Baker, former mayor of Portland and founder of the Oregon Democratic People's Party, is a name that has become increasingly known within Oregon. Ever since the Republic of Oregon was declared, Baker has emerged at the forefront of the Oregon rightwing. A Populist, Baker is known for his fiery oratory. This much was proved a short few hours ago, when Baker gave a fiery speech in the small eastern oregon town of Baker. In his speech, Baker heavily and wholeheartedly denounced the Communists, calling them 'Rapid dogs, only worthy of being shot.' He also denounced  the Salem government  just as heavily,  calling us 'A bunch of useless men sitting around arguing about how to deal with Reds, instead of just shooting them.' He went on to describe his dream for Oregon:One free of Communists, Liberals and 'Jewish Influences'. He also said that this dream would not, and in fact, could not, stop at the Columbia and Snake rivers. This dream he said, must encompass ALL of Oregon. He ended his speech by issuing the 'Baker Declaration' a document laying down the basis for a new government of Oregon, as well as putting his ideas into practice. Baker's message, of a new Oregon for and by Oregonians, resonates heavily with the people of Eastern Oregon, and in fact the majority of counties in Eastern Oregon have pledged themselves to Baker and his Declaration."

    OS.5.d:0 "Following the issuing of the Baker Declaration, the past few days and weeks have seen a massive spike in travel to the Eastern portion of the state. We now know why. Baker and his goons in the ODPP have been moving men and arms to Eastern Oregon in preparation for their revolt, which took place this morning. Much like with the communists, an uneasy peace is still felt in the air, but all it takes is a spark to light a powderkeg...."

    OS.6.t:0 "Southern Oregon declares independence"
    OS.6.d:0 "Following the declaration of Martial Law, southern Oregon, a  temperate and politically moderate region, although being loyal to Salem, whispers of independence could be heard agmoust the populus. Despite these whispers, southern Oregon stayed with Salem, hoping that the Reds would be dealt with soon, and that republican government would soon return to Oregon. However, when the Reds solidified themselves in the SRO, the dreams of a quick return to normalcy faded.  However, due to the SRO being isolated to the Willamette Valley, those in the southern part of Oregon expected that little fighting would take place in their neck of the woods, and so the whispers, although growing louder, were still just that, whispers. With the rise of the Unitary Republic however, this changed. Fighting would be taking place all over Oregon, and with that knowledge, the southern counties could take no more. The southern counties have formally severed all ties with the Salem government, and declared independence from the Republic of Oregon. Together, the counties have formed the Jeffersonian Republic, and have laid claim to northern California, stating that the northern Californians have suffered similar tyranny as themselves. The Salem government is now reduced to a small strip of the coast and Marian and Linn counties."

    OS.7.t:0 "The John Day Massacre"
    OS.7.d:0 "Following the foundation of our glorious nation, the ODPP as they rightly should have, assumed all control over all functions of government, abolishing all power structures, save for the Party-State. Doing this has granted ODPP militias almost unlimited power in regards to judicial activities. One such militia, loyal to the Ku Klux Klan faction of the party, has exercised this power with unmatched bloodiness. The militia had rounded up 3000 Papists, Blacks and other degenerates. These 3000 were marched from all around the Unitary Republic and taken to the small town of John Day. Once they arrived, the 3000 were paraded throughout the town, as townsfolk hurled insults, and the occasional rock. At the end of the marching, all were either hung, shot or set on fire and left to burn alive. Some of the Papists died screaming ‘Long Live Christ the King!’ However horrific, President Baker is slow to condemn the action, as his long term plan for Oregon is to put an end to these same people. Not through killing them, but through generations. Despite this, the incident is bound to spread outside of our borders, and Baker’s inaction may prove fatal."
    OS.7.a:0 "They acted too fast!"

    OS.8.t:0 "Unrest among the Catholics"
    OS.8.d:0 "Following the John Day incident, Catholics from all over the Unitary Republic have begun organizing into small militias, bent on 'avenging the blood of the John Day Martyrs.' The clergy itself is divided, with some supportive of the militias and others against them. Bishop of the Diocese of Baker City, Joseph McGrath, has so far been silent on the actions of both the Catholic militias and the Unitary Government."
    OS.8.a:0 "Damn Papists!"

    OS.9.t:0 "Unrest among the Blacks"
    OS.9.d:0 "Following the John Day incident, Blacks, although making up less then one percent of the population, have begun to form self-defence militias, mostly based around Pendleton and The Dallas. Although disunited at first, a majority of these militias have united around Geroge Hardin, the first black sheriff deputy for Multnomah County. Although they are quite small, should they be left unchecked they will prove to be quite the nuisance."
    OS.9.a:0 "Damn Negros!" 

    OS.10.t:0 "Purge of the Oregon Democractic People's Party"
    OS.10.d:0 "President Baker, after days of inaction, and following growing unrest within the Black and Catholic populations, has finally taken action. The ODPP's ranks have been purged of all those who belonged to, or were thought to belong to the KKK.  The President hopes this will be enough to smooth over the rebellious populus of Eastern Oregon."
    OS.10.a:0 "This had better be enough!"

    OS.11.t:0 "The Catholics rise! The Principality of Oregon declared!"
    OS.11.d:0 "Following the rise of various Catholic militias, in an attempt to damage their morale, and perhaps convince them to lay down arms, Bishop McGrath was arrested by the Unitary Republic’s secret police. However, this did not have the desired effect at all. Instead of hurting their morale, the arrest of the Bishop seems to have boosted their conviction. Earlier today the  ‘Legion of Mary’ and the ‘Soldiers of the Sacred Heart,’ the two largest Catholic militias, launched an attack on our provisional capital of Baker. After only a few hours of fighting, they managed to seize control of the town. Luckily for President Baker, he was outside of the capitol, inspecting freshly trained troops in Prineville, which has been acting as an important staging area for the coming war with the Communist Dogs and the traitors of Salem. Although reports are hard to come by, as the loss of the capitol is causing a period of chaos within the political and military hierarchy, it appears that the Papists have freed their Bishop. It also appears that they created a new government, although highly unorganized. This new government, what they are calling the ‘Principality of Oregon’ is claiming to be the legitimate government of all of Oregon! Apparently it is headed, although very reluctantly, by newly crowned Prince-Bishop McGrath, one of only two Bishops in the entire world who can claim that title. The Prince-Bishop has, although quite clearly not very enthusiastically, called on all Catholics, Oregonian or otherwise, to rise up against corrupt governments. He also called for any soldiers to come to aid of the Principality. According to some reports, this call has been answered by veterans of the Cristero War in Mexico. Due to being so disorganized, the Papists have not been able to gain much ground other than what they already have, so much like between us, the Reds and Salem, an uneasy peace is reigning."

    OS.12.t:0 "The rise of Neo-Afrika"
    OS.12.d:0 "It appears that the black population of the URO was not interested in fighting. After a series of short battles between local garrisons and the Black militias, the victorious militias, occupying the cities of the Dallas and Pendleton, declared independence from Oregon entity, forming the nation of Neo Afrika, under the leadership of George Hardin. Neo Afrika, to the blacks of Oregon, is a chance to start a new, in land free of segregation and racial hatred. However, they make up less than one percent of Neo Afrika's population, making the new nation a powderkeg it's own right."
    OS.12.a:0 "Let them go, for now..."

    OS.13.t:0 "The Klan Revolts!"
    OS.13.d:0 "The Klan has not taken been purged lightly. About half of the militias that made up the ODPP's military wing belonged to the Klan, and have begun an open revolt. Although the first wave of the revolt was crushed, the Klan is still holding on to the southern half of Malheur county, basing themselves out of the small town of Rome."

    OS.14.t:0 "Unrest in Wallowa County"
    OS.14.d:0 "In the Northeast of the Unitary Republic’s held territory lies the small country of Wallowa. Wallowa County is a very small area, having less than 10 thousand people living within its borders. Due to this, the only real presence we have in the area is a small garrison to guard the Washington and Idaho borders, along with a small party commission to handle local affairs. However, it seems that the population, mostly farmers and lumbermen, has not taken the John Day Massacre quietly. A large part of the population has stopped showing up to work, as can be seen in the massively unfulfilled quotas of timber and foodstuffs. What is more, our garrison has been attacked on more than one occasion by an unknown force. It is not hard to put 2 and 2 together, although due to the small size of the population, it should not be that hard to crush this unrest, at least it would be. With rising tensions in the Papist and Negro populations, Wallowa County is basically cut off from the rest of the Unitary Republic, thus our troops are unable to come and crush the rebels."
    OS.14.a:0 "Damn liberals!"

    OS.15.t:0 "Casacadian Revolt"
    OS.15.d:0 "Following the growing unrest and even revolts within the Papist and Negro population, the small band of rebels in Wallowa County have successfully defeated our garrison and have proclaimed victory over us. Strangely enough, in a search for an identity, they have declared themselves to be the ‘Provisional Government of Cascadia,’ claiming everything from the Alexander Archipelago to Northern California. This outrageous government is headed by Guy Cordon, a former attorney in Douglas County. Provisional Cascadia is weak, and if it were not for the rising tensions within our land, we would easily crush them. For now, we are simply forced to let them go."

    OS.16.t:0 "Growing instability in Portland"
    OS.16.d:0 "As the glorious Oregon Red Army entered the city of Portland, we were not without allies. The anarcho-syndicalist trade union, the IWW lent us a massive amount of aid, in the form of strikes, and even in some cases, taking entire districts for us. For this, we were grateful, and we thought that, being allowed to join the Socialist Republic, the IWW too would be grateful. However, this could not be further from the truth. Upon being annexed into the SRO, the IWW began to complain of ‘tyranny’ and called us ‘worse then the capitalists.’ Hogwash, obviously, but they have not quieted down, and have even formed a rival government, the Portland Commune, in oppression to the Council of People’s Commissars, a group handpicked by Chairman Reed himself! As of now, no violence has taken place, but the chance is lingering over like a rain cloud. Normally, something like this could be dealt with easily, however with the Bourgeois government in Salem poised to strike at any moment, we can not divert resources to deal with the unrest."
    OS.16.a:0 "Keep a close eye on them..."

    OS.17.t:0 "The Portland Commune declares independence from Oregon"
    OS.17.d:0 "In an attempt to placate the IWW’s newly proclaimed Portland Commune and in order to have more troops on the front with the Salem government, the Oregon Red Army garrison that was stationed in the city has been recalled, and ordered to the eastern border. In the asspence of the Red Army, the Portland Worker’s Council, a body made up of representatives elected from every district, trade union, guild or like-minded thing, has declared their unilateral independence from Oregon. While normally this type of behavior would see the Red Army march and crush them without mercy, Chairman Reed, in his infinite wisdom, has declared the Portland Commune to be an ally in the fight against the capitalists. While this has our Soviet advisors in a bit of a tizzy, Reed has assured them in private that they could be a ‘useful idiot’ to have as an ally. However, it is clear from the outset that Portland is going to fall into anarchy. The Council of People’s Commissars still exists, and the remnants of the old mayoral government have emerged! Chairman Reed is determined that, with enough funds, ammo and food, that the CPC will emerge on top, but there is no way to tell for sure."

    OS.18.t:0 "The Klamath Offensive"
    OS.18.d:0 "What started as simply a half-joking suggestion by a lower officer of the Unitary Republic's armed forces is becoming a reality. Following the loss of over half of the URO's terrority, we have no easy route from which to begin our conquest of the western half of Oregon. This where the Klamath Offensive comes in. Using tactics borrowed from the German blitz through Belgium, we shall quickly move through and take Klamath from the rebellious Jeffersonian Republic, and from there, quickly move in and take Bend from the Communist dogs. From Bend, we shall control the gateway to the Willamette Valley, which will surely be an easy victory. Once we have victory in the west, we can quickly mop up the remains of the Papists, Klan and Casacadians." 
    OS.18.a:0 "An excellent plan! Begin the offensive!"

    OS.19.t:0 "Unitary Republic planning Invasion!"
    OS.19.d:0 "  Word has reached the Jeffersonian government from our eastern border. The Unitary Republic of Oregon, one of the now six governments claiming our land, is launching an offensive which aims to take Klamath! This is surely the greatest threat that has ever faced our young country, but if we are to truly be a free nation, we must face them the same fervor that drove the Continental Army to survive Valley Forge!"
    OS.19.a:0 "Klamath will be our Trenton! Ready what defences we can!"

    OS.20.t:0 "The Klamath Offensive stalls"
    OS.20.d:0 "Following an uninterrupted series of victories in Klamath County, URO troops have hit a major stalling point. While URO troops were pushing deep into the county, Jeffersonian forces were digging in around Klamath Falls itself. When URO troops arrived at Klamath Falls, instead of meeting no resistance and walking into the town as heros, the armed forces of the Unitary Republic met gunfire. After several useless and deadly charges, the URO forces tug in as well. Two trenches now circle Klamath Falls, and until the town falls, the Klamath Offensive is effectively dead in the water."

    OS.21.d:0 "After a week of bloody trench warfare, increabiley reminiscent of the Great War, Klamath Falls has finally fallen under the complete control of the Unitary Republic of Oregon. This marks the effective end of the Klamath Offensive, although some pockets of Jeffersonian troops remain. The URO has made no signs that they intend to keep pushing into Jefferson. Infact, URO troops are a very rare sight on the Jefferson-URO border. Commanders in the Jeffersonian army see this as evidence that they are starting to prepare for an invasion of the Socialist Republic, but this is simply a guess. Although over, many international commentators fear that this, the bloody trench warfare of the invasion of Klamath, is a sign of things to come."

Once the go-ahead is received, our armed forces will march on Bend from all directions, taking it in a headon battle. Once we have captured Bend, phase three, the conquest of the Willamette Valley will take place. All we need to do is capture Bend."

    OS.23.d:0 "Chairman Reed! Our scouts on our border with the Unitary Republic have just sighted what looks like a huge assault from the URO! They appear to headed for the small town of Bend. Bend is right on our border, and is perhaps our most fortired position. They seem to think we left it unguarded or at least undermanned . Local garrison commanders are poised to strike, but are waiting for your confirmation."

    OS.24.t:0 "Beginning of the Oregon Civil War"
    OS.24.d:0 "This morning, the first shots of the Oregon Civil War were fired, on the outskirts of the small town of Bend. This opening fighting between the Socialist Republic and Unitary Republic has led to the other factions that emerged in the past few months to also starting fighting. Trenches are already lining a good portion of the old state, and veterans of the Great War weep that their own children have brought hell they went through a short 20 years ago, back from the pages of history. Oregon is now at war, and hundreds if not thousands will die before she is reunited again."
