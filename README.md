# North America Divided

 NOTE: ASK BEFORE USING ANYTHING NATIVE TO OUR MOD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. WE WILL ALMOST ALWAYS ACCEPT :)

 If youre going to be using development / github branches of the mod, 
 Github Desktop (https://desktop.github.com) is highly reccommended, 
 although not essential. Github Desktop provides an easy way to sync changes. 
 
 ## With Github Desktop
	Using Github Desktop, once you have set up the application and have an account, 
	Click File â†’ Clone Repository in the dialog box, under URL insert
   `https://github.com/BattleSkorpion/nadivided-dev`. and clone it into
   `Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod` under your user's Documents
   folder! Then click "Clone," of course. 
   Next, Open the new folder using a file explorer. Drag `nadivided-dev.mod`
   into the `mod` folder. Start up HOI4,
   and select our mod (local version). 
   
   ***Select the branch you want to use in Github before launching the game.*** 
   ***If unsure ask someone dear to your heart who is knowledgeable***
   
# Enjoy :)
